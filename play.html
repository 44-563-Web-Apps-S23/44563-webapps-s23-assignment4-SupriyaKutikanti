        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> <direction>[_In a chiding, motherly way._]</direction> Ohano, my child, you must not be
        so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
        _enchanted_ ball?</speech></p>
 
        <div class = "OHANO" ><h6>OHANO.</h6></div><p><speech> Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
        to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
        story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
        myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
        at it in vain.</speech></p>

        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
        way to destruction!</speech></p>

        <div class = "OHANO" ><h6>OHANO.</h6></div><p><speech> Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
        keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
        if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.</speech></p>

        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</speech></p>

        <div class = "OHANO" ><h6>OHANO.</h6></div><p><speech> Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
        lover has been away so long----</speech></p>

        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
        boat----</speech></p>

        <div class = "OHANO" ><h6>OHANO.</h6></div><p><speech> Nijo's boat? Where?</speech></p>

        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> It be near the edge of the island just where----</speech></p>

        <div class = "OHANO" ><h6>OHANO.</h6></div><p><speech> Why didn't you tell me before?</speech></p>

        <div class = "ZAMA" ><h6>ZAMA.</h6></div><p><speech> I came to--but I be forgetting when I see you at that evil ball
        again.</speech></p>
